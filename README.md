The assignment should be implemented as Windows Form applications (not Command Prompt).Always write your code in the most general way, i.e. taking care that you wonâ€™t need to change your source code, besides, maybe, constants, when a different data set should be processed. Using constants and enumerations are good means to meet this criterion. Following this principle will make your programs easy to maintain.The program should direct the user to input two numbers: MIN and MAX (MIN &lt;= MAX). Starting with the number MIN and ending with the number MAX, in ascending order, create an output line listing its prime factors in ascending order, each preceded by a colon. Skip the lines starting with the prime numbers.Below is an example of the output for MIN = 6 and MAX = 9.6:2:38:2:2:29:3:3MIN = 8; MAX = 8 is a valid input resulting in a single line as output. MIN = 11; MAX = 11 will result in no output.You should not pre-populate your program with a table of prime factors.Additional consideration. TextBox is a strong candidate for directing and accumulating the output. Its advantage over Label is the presence of sliders, so there is no limit to how many lines of output can fit in it.
